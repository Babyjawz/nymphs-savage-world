# 🌿 Meet the Nymph Nerds

![Nymph Nerds](assets/nerds.png)

The merry band of modding misfits who keep **Nymph’s Savage World** alive, cursed, and (somehow) playable:  

---

## 🌿 Babyjaws — *Keeper of the Wabbajack* 🪄  
Wrangles installers, keeps the forest standing, and fights bugbeasts daily.  

---

## 🔨 Rauty79 — *Combat Conjuror* ⚔️  
Co-founder of the list, master of battle balance, and all-round fixer of chaos.  

---

## 💨 Bfam_Cage — *Patch Pirate* 📜  
Our CK & xEdit wizard — knows the arcane scrolls better than anyone else.  

---

## 🪄 Nyx — *Enchantress of Outfits* 👗  
Weaver of robes, armor, and stylish chaos. If it looks good, Nyx probably conjured it.  

---

## 📯 BackbeatN — *The Vuvuzela Mage* 🎺  
Appears out of nowhere with strange mod suggestions… then vanishes into the mist again.  

---

✨ Together we wrangle mods, summon chaos, and somehow deliver a playable Skyrim.
