## Controller / Keybinding Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This mod must be placed **low in your load order (LO)** or its keybinds/widgets can be overridden.

---

## Requirements

* **[Nymphs ‚Äì Controller (MO2 one-click link)](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=667335&game_id=1704&nmm=1)**
* **[Nymphs ‚Äì Controller (Manual Download)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667335)**
  * Provides the custom controlmap, `.ini` settings, and an OSTIM MCM Recorder profile.
* **[OStim Settings Folder (GitHub mirror)](https://github.com/Babyjawz/nymphs-savage-world/raw/refs/heads/main/Submissions/OStim.7z)**  
  *(Needed for OStim scene controls. The same folder is also included in the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod. You only need to copy it manually if you **don‚Äôt use MCM Recorder**.)*
* **[Soulsy HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74460)**  
  *(Optional but fully recommended, already preconfigured for this setup.)*

---

## What This Mod Includes

This controller package is more than just a controlmap ‚Äî it provides a **complete out-of-the-box setup** for Skyrim AE:

* **Custom Controlmap**
  * `Interface\Controls\PC\controlmap.txt` ‚Üí editable text map for SKSE / Auto Input Switch  
  * `ControlMap_Custom.txt` (root folder) ‚Üí precompiled snapshot, so **you don‚Äôt need to Reset Controls** in Skyrim  

* **Preconfigured Settings**
  * `.ini` files for:
    * One Click Power Attack  
    * TK Dodge  
    * True Directional Movement (target lock, sprint, dodge, etc.)  

* **OStim Settings**  
  This setup comes with two parts:  

  1. **MCM Recorder Profile** ‚Äì bundled in the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod.  
     * If you use [MCM Recorder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61719), this profile will auto-configure OSTIM for you.  

  2. **OStim Settings Folder** ‚Äì provided both inside the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod and here on GitHub.  
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è If you **do not use MCM Recorder**, you **must** manually copy this folder into your documents:  
       `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\OStim`

---

## Notes

* Place this mod **low in your load order** so no other controlmap replacers override it.  
* If you ever press **Reset Controls** in Skyrim, the game will regenerate a new `ControlMap_Custom.txt`. That can override this snapshot.  
  * If your bindings stop working after a reset, simply delete the new `ControlMap_Custom.txt` and let the packaged one take effect again.  

---

## Why This Matters

* Ensures consistent gameplay and combat behavior with controller bindings  
* Saves you from having to tweak MCM menus manually  
* Provides ready-to-use settings for common animation/combat mods  
* Works immediately on a new save thanks to the bundled compiled controlmap

‚ö†Ô∏è **OStim Settings Profile Required**  
This setup relies on the OSTIM profile (bundled for MCM Recorder, or the manually copied folder).  
- With **MCM Recorder**: the profile auto-loads.  
- Without **MCM Recorder**: you **must manually copy** the provided OStim folder into:  
  `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\OStim`

Once applied:  
- **Play Skyrim normally** with the controller ‚Äî movement, combat, menus, and exploration all work as expected.  
- **LB (Left Bumper)** is your **‚Äúmodifier key‚Äù**. Holding LB changes what many other buttons do.  
- **Soulsy HUD integration** (if installed): Use the D-Pad to quickly equip weapons, powers, or potions without opening menus.  
- **Menus are accessible** with LB + A/B/Y for Inventory, Tween Menu, Map.  
- **OStim support**: If installed, you can start and manage scenes using stick clicks and X+D-Pad combos.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if unassigned.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**.  
- **Shoulder Swap (LB double-tap + R3):** Requires [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252).  

---

## üß™ Notes From Testing
1. Smooth Zoom replaces vanilla zoom and doesn‚Äôt interfere with lock-on.  
2. Sneak is safer: LB+L3 prevents accidental crouch mid-combat.  
3. Sprint redundancy: L3 or Hold B.  
4. OStim fully playable without a numpad.  
5. Unified config: works with both controller + keyboard.  
6. Shoulder Swap with SmoothCam feels natural.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Clear old controlmap files** ‚Üí Delete `controlmap_custom.txt` in MO2‚Äôs Overwrite (NOT from the mod itself).  
- **Re-apply Steam Config** ‚Üí From the Steam link or Manage ‚Üí Controller Layout.  

üí¨ Problems? Ask in Discord ‚Äî feedback helps polish the setup.
