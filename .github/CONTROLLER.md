## üéÆ Quick Start: How to Use the Controller

This setup turns your **Steam-compatible controller** (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, or any other pad supported by Steam Input) into a full Skyrim control scheme designed for **Nymph‚Äôs Savage World**.  

The guide uses **Xbox button names** (A/B/X/Y, LB/RB, etc.) for clarity, but the bindings will still work on PlayStation, Switch, or other controllers ‚Äî only the button labels differ.  

‚ú® **Recommended**: [Soulsy HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96210)  
Not required, but highly recommended for the full experience. It unlocks **quick-assign and cycling features** on the D-Pad for weapons, powers, shouts, and potions. (*Soulsy HUD is already bundled in Nymph‚Äôs Savage World ‚Äî just make sure it‚Äôs enabled.*)  

‚öôÔ∏è **OStim Configs**:  
If you use OStim, install the included config files by unzipping them into:  
C:\Users<YourName>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\OStim

This ensures all scene controls (stick clicks, speed control, animation selection, etc.) match this guide.  

Once applied:  
- **Play Skyrim normally** with the controller ‚Äî movement, combat, menus, and exploration all work as expected.  
- **LB (Left Bumper)** is your **‚Äúmodifier key‚Äù**. Holding LB changes what many other buttons do (for example: *LT blocks*, but *LB+LT performs a Duel Block*).  
- **Soulsy HUD integration**: Use the D-Pad to quickly equip weapons, powers, or potions without opening menus. Assign items in your inventory, then cycle them with the D-Pad while playing.  
- **Menus are accessible** with simple combos: LB+A opens inventory, LB+B opens the Tween menu, LB+Y shows the map, LB+Select quickloads, LB+Start opens the Journal.  
- **OStim support**: If installed, you can start and manage scenes using stick clicks and X+D-Pad combos. 
- **Universal shortcuts** (always available): Hold X + D-Pad Down modifies bodies, and Hold X + L3 opens the OBody menu.  

üëâ Think of LB as the ‚Äúmagic shift key‚Äù that unlocks extra layers of control.  
If something doesn‚Äôt respond the first time (like Sprint or Dodge), try the alternative method ‚Äî both are included for flexibility.  

You don‚Äôt need to memorize everything at once:  
1. Start with **movement and combat basics**.  
2. Add **Soulsy HUD** quick-assigns for faster item/power use.  
3. Learn **menus** (LB + face buttons).  
4. Explore **OStim scene controls** once you‚Äôre comfortable.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included for flexibility.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if no hotkey is assigned in your setup.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Hold/release or tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**. Without it, this action is not available.

## üß™ Notes From Testing

This config is still being tested, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with the improvements.  
It solves several long-standing problems that have bugged me since playing Skyrim on controller:

1. **Terrible vanilla zoom system** ‚Üí replaced with smooth zoom that no longer interferes with target lock.  
2. **Sneak auto-triggering mid-combat** ‚Üí now requires LB + Left Stick click, no more accidental deaths.  
3. **Unreliable vanilla sprint** ‚Üí now has dual inputs (L3 or B hold) for consistency.  
4. **OStim only working on extended keyboards** ‚Üí now fully mapped for controller, no keypad required.  
5. **Unified config** ‚Üí one layout that works with both controller *and* keyboard, no need to maintain two setups.

üí¨ If anything is unclear, or you run into problems: **please ask!**  
Feedback is welcome while testing continues ‚Äî this guide and config will improve over time.
