## üéÆ Quick Start: How to Use the Controller

This setup turns your Steam-compatible controller (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, etc.) into a full Skyrim control scheme designed for **Nymph‚Äôs Savage World**.

It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù ‚Äî you need to apply the provided Steam Controller Config first (see setup instructions below).  

‚ú® **Recommended Mod**: [Soulsy HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96210)  
Not strictly required, but highly recommended for the **full experience**.  
Soulsy HUD unlocks quick-assign and cycling features for weapons, powers, and potions.  
(*Already included with Nymph‚Äôs Savage World ‚Äî just make sure it‚Äôs enabled in your loadout.*)  

Once applied:  
- **Play Skyrim normally** with the controller ‚Äî movement, combat, menus, and exploration all work as expected.  
- **LB (Left Bumper)** is your **‚Äúmodifier key‚Äù**. Holding LB changes what many other buttons do (for example: *LT blocks*, but *LB+LT performs a Duel Block*).  
- **Soulsy HUD integration**: Use the D-Pad to quickly equip weapons, powers, or potions without opening menus. Assign items in your inventory, then cycle them with the D-Pad while playing.  
- **Menus are accessible** with simple combos: LB+A opens inventory, LB+B opens the Tween menu, LB+Y shows the map, LB+Select quickloads, LB+Start opens the Journal.  
- **OStim support**: If installed, you can start and manage scenes using stick clicks and X+D-Pad combos. A mini diagram is included below for scene controls.  
- **Universal shortcuts** (always available): Hold X + D-Pad Down modifies bodies, and Hold X + L3 opens the OBody menu.  

üëâ Think of LB as the ‚Äúmagic shift key‚Äù that unlocks extra layers of control.  
If something doesn‚Äôt respond the first time (like Sprint or Dodge), try the alternative method ‚Äî both are included for flexibility.  

You don‚Äôt need to memorize everything at once:  
1. Start with **movement and combat basics**.  
2. Add **Soulsy HUD** quick-assigns for faster item/power use.  
3. Learn **menus** (LB + face buttons).  
4. Explore **OStim scene controls** once you‚Äôre comfortable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included for flexibility.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if no hotkey is assigned in your setup.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Hold/release or tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**. Without it, this action is not available.
