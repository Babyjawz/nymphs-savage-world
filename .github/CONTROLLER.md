## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if unassigned.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**.  
- **Shoulder Swap (LB double-tap + R3):** Requires [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252).

## 🧪 Notes From Testing
1. Smooth Zoom replaces vanilla zoom and doesn’t interfere with lock-on.  
2. Sneak is safer: LB+L3 prevents accidental crouch mid-combat.  
3. Sprint redundancy: L3 or Hold B.  
4. OStim fully playable without a numpad.  
5. Unified config: works with both controller + keyboard.  
6. Shoulder Swap with SmoothCam feels natural.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Clear old controlmap files** → Delete `controlmap_custom.txt` in MO2’s Overwrite.  
- **Reset controls** → In Skyrim settings, Reset to Defaults.  
- **Re-apply Steam Config** → From the Steam link or Manage → Controller Layout.
