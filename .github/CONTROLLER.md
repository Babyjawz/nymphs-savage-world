‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Setup Required**

1. **Clear old controlmap files**  
   Before doing anything else, check your **Overwrite** folder in Mod Organizer 2.  
   If there is a file called `controlmap_custom.txt`, delete it.  
   (Old controlmaps will conflict with this Steam Input setup.)  

2. **Apply the Steam Controller Configuration**  
   üëâ [Apply Steam Config] copy and paste this into your browser or the Windows Run box:
   
         steam://controllerconfig/489830/3570734209

   and apply the config

    IF THE ABOVE METHOD DOESNT WORK ONLY, try the following:

**Desktop Mode (no Big Picture needed):**  
- In Steam, right-click **Skyrim Special Edition** in your Library.  
- Select **Manage ‚Üí Controller Layout**.  
- Choose **Browse Configs ‚Üí Community**.  
- Search for **Nymph‚Äôs Savage World Config** (ID: `3570734209`) and apply it.  

**Big Picture Mode (optional):**  
- Open Steam in **Big Picture Mode**.  
- Go to **Skyrim Special Edition ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Controller Layout**.  
- Select **Browse Configs ‚Üí Community**.  
- Search for **Nymph‚Äôs Savage World Config** (ID: `3570734209`) and apply it.  

3. **Reset Skyrim controls**  
In Skyrim‚Äôs **Settings ‚Üí Controls** menu, choose **Reset to Defaults**.  
This ensures no leftover bindings interfere with the Steam configuration.

**OStim Settings Required**  
Download the matching OStim settings archive:  
‚û°Ô∏è [OStim.7z](https://github.com/Babyjawz/nymphs-savage-world/raw/refs/heads/main/Submissions/OStim.7z)  

Unzip the archive into:  

C:\Users<YourName>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\OStim

This ensures all scene controls (stick clicks, speed control, animation selection, etc.) match this guide.  

Once applied:  
- **Play Skyrim normally** with the controller ‚Äî movement, combat, menus, and exploration all work as expected.  
- **LB (Left Bumper)** is your **‚Äúmodifier key‚Äù**. Holding LB changes what many other buttons do (for example: *LT blocks*, but *LB+RB performs a shout*).  
- **Soulsy HUD integration**: Use the D-Pad to quickly equip weapons, powers, or potions without opening menus. Assign items in your inventory, then cycle them with the D-Pad while playing.  
- **Menus are accessible** with simple combos: LB+A opens inventory, LB+B opens the Tween menu, LB+Y shows the map, LB+Select quickloads, LB+Start opens the Journal.  
- **OStim support**: If installed, you can start and manage scenes using stick clicks and X+D-Pad combos.  
- **Universal shortcuts** (always available): Hold X + D-Pad Down modifies bodies, and Hold X + L3 opens the OBody menu.  

üëâ Think of LB as the ‚Äúmagic shift key‚Äù that unlocks extra layers of control.  
If something doesn‚Äôt respond the first time (like Sprint or Dodge), try the alternative method ‚Äî both are included for flexibility.  

You don‚Äôt need to memorize everything at once:  
1. Start with **movement and combat basics**.  
2. Add **Soulsy HUD** quick-assigns for faster item/power use.  
3. Learn **menus** (LB + face buttons).  
4. Explore **OStim scene controls** once you‚Äôre comfortable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included for flexibility.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if no hotkey is assigned in your setup.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Hold/release or tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**. Without it, this action is not available.  
- **Shoulder Swap (LB double-tap + R3):** Requires [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252).

## üß™ Notes From Testing

This config is still being tested, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with the improvements.  
It solves several long-standing problems that have bugged me since playing Skyrim on controller:

1. **Terrible vanilla zoom system** ‚Üí replaced with smooth zoom that no longer interferes with target lock.  
2. **Sneak auto-triggering mid-combat** ‚Üí now requires LB + Left Stick click, no more accidental deaths.  
3. **Unreliable vanilla sprint** ‚Üí now has dual inputs (L3 or B hold) for consistency.  
4. **OStim requiring an extended keyboard with numpad** ‚Üí now fully usable on any controller or compact keyboard, no numpad required.  
5. **Unified config** ‚Üí one layout that works with both controller *and* keyboard, no need to maintain two setups.  
6. **SmoothCam shoulder swap** ‚Üí mapped to LB double-tap + R3 for immersion-friendly over-the-shoulder play.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Clear old controlmap files**  
  If you have a `controlmap_custom.txt` inside your **Overwrite** folder in Mod Organizer 2 (or anywhere else in your mod setup), delete it.  
  Leaving old controlmaps in place will conflict with this Steam Input setup.  

- **Reset controls in Skyrim**  
  If things feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù (wrong buttons, menus not opening correctly), go into Skyrim‚Äôs **Settings ‚Üí Controls** menu and choose **Reset to Defaults**.  
  This makes sure the game isn‚Äôt applying mismatched bindings on top of the Steam configuration.  

- **Re-apply the Steam Config**  
  If all else fails, reapply the Steam controller layout from the link above or via **Manage ‚Üí Controller Layout** in Steam.

üí¨ If anything is unclear, or you run into problems: **please ask!**  
Feedback is welcome while testing continues ‚Äî this guide and config will improve over time.
