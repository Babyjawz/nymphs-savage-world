## Controller / Keybinding Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This mod must be placed **low in your load order (LO)** or its keybinds/widgets can be overridden.

---

## Requirements

* **[Nymphs ‚Äì Controller (MO2 one-click link)](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=667335&game_id=1704&nmm=1)**
* **[Nymphs ‚Äì Controller (Manual Download)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667335)**
  * Provides the custom controlmap, `.ini` settings, and an OSTIM MCM Recorder profile.
* **[OStim Settings Folder (GitHub mirror)](https://github.com/Babyjawz/nymphs-savage-world/raw/refs/heads/main/Submissions/OStim.7z)**  
  *(Needed for OStim scene controls. The same folder is also included in the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod. You only need to copy it manually if you **don‚Äôt use MCM Recorder**.)*
* **[Soulsy HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74460)**  
  *(Optional but fully recommended, already preconfigured for this setup.)*

---

## What This Mod Includes

This controller package is more than just a controlmap ‚Äî it provides a **complete out-of-the-box setup** for Skyrim AE:

* **Custom Controlmap**
  * `Interface\Controls\PC\controlmap.txt` ‚Üí editable text map for SKSE / Auto Input Switch  
  * `ControlMap_Custom.txt` (root folder) ‚Üí precompiled snapshot, so **you don‚Äôt need to Reset Controls** in Skyrim  

* **Preconfigured Settings**
  * `.ini` files for:
    * One Click Power Attack  
    * TK Dodge  
    * True Directional Movement (target lock, sprint, dodge, etc.)  

* **OStim Settings**  
  This setup comes with two parts:  

  1. **MCM Recorder Profile** ‚Äì bundled in the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod.  
     * If you use [MCM Recorder](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61719), this profile will auto-configure OSTIM for you.  

  2. **OStim Settings Folder** ‚Äì provided both inside the Nymphs ‚Äì Controller mod and here on GitHub.  
     * ‚ö†Ô∏è If you **do not use MCM Recorder**, you **must** manually copy this folder into your documents:  
       `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\OStim`

---

## Notes

* Place this mod **low in your load order** so no other controlmap replacers override it.  
* If you ever press **Reset Controls** in Skyrim, the game will regenerate a new `ControlMap_Custom.txt`. That can override this snapshot.  
  * If your bindings stop working after a reset, simply delete the new `ControlMap_Custom.txt` and let the packaged one take effect again.  

---

## Why This Matters

* Ensures consistent gameplay and combat behavior with controller bindings  
* Saves you from having to tweak MCM menus manually  
* Provides ready-to-use settings for common animation/combat mods  
* Works immediately on a new save thanks to the bundled compiled controlmap

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
- **Dodge & Sprint (L3 / B):** Both mapped for dodge (tap) and sprint (hold). Neither is perfectly reliable, so both are included for flexibility.  
- **Horse & Lantern hotkeys:** Do nothing if no hotkey is assigned in your setup.  
- **OStim actions:** Speed control/selection depend on animation support. Free Camera & Auto-Play are always available.  
- **Universal shortcuts:** `X + D-Pad Down` and `X + L3` are global, usable outside OStim.  
- **Hold-X layer:** Can get stuck (prevents forward movement). Hold/release or tap **X** to reset.  
- **Power Attack (RB):** Requires **One Click Power Attack (OCPA)**. Without it, this action is not available.  
- **Shoulder Swap (LB double-tap + R3):** Requires [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252).

## üß™ Notes From Testing

This config is still being tested, but so far I‚Äôm very happy with the improvements.  
It solves several long-standing problems that have bugged me since playing Skyrim on controller:

1. **Terrible vanilla zoom system** ‚Üí replaced with smooth zoom that no longer interferes with target lock.  
2. **Sneak auto-triggering mid-combat** ‚Üí now requires LB + Left Stick click, no more accidental deaths.  
3. **Unreliable vanilla sprint** ‚Üí now has dual inputs (L3 or B hold) for consistency.  
4. **OStim requiring an extended keyboard with numpad** ‚Üí now fully usable on any controller or compact keyboard, no numpad required.  
5. **Unified config** ‚Üí one layout that works with both controller *and* keyboard, no need to maintain two setups.  
6. **SmoothCam shoulder swap** ‚Üí mapped to LB double-tap + R3 for immersion-friendly over-the-shoulder play.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Clear old controlmap files**  
  If you have a `controlmap_custom.txt` inside your **Overwrite** folder in Mod Organizer 2 (or anywhere else in your mod setup), delete it.  
  Leaving old controlmaps in place will conflict with this Steam Input setup.  

- **Reset controls in Skyrim**  
  If things feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù (wrong buttons, menus not opening correctly), go into Skyrim‚Äôs **Settings ‚Üí Controls** menu and choose **Reset to Defaults**.  
  This makes sure the game isn‚Äôt applying mismatched bindings on top of the Steam configuration.  

- **Re-apply the Steam Config**  
  If all else fails, reapply the Steam controlle
