This guide will help you install the list step by step.

## ▶️ Step 1 — Prepare Skyrim

1. Make sure you have **Skyrim Special Edition** (Steam).  
2. In Steam, right-click Skyrim → **Properties** → **Updates**  
   - Set to: **Only update this game when I launch it**  
3. Install **all Anniversary Edition content** (from the Steam “Manage DLC” menu).  
   - ⚠️ Do not alt-tab out while this is downloading — let it finish.  
4. Launch Skyrim once from Steam to generate the base config files.  
   - Set graphics options & quit.

## ▶️ Step 2 — Install Wabbajack

- 📥 Download the **Wabbajack app installer**:  
  👉 [Wabbajack Releases (official)](https://www.wabbajack.org/)  

- Place `Wabbajack.exe` in a dedicated folder (e.g., `D:\Wabbajack`) outside of `Program Files`.

## ▶️ Step 3 — Get the NSW Modlist

- 📦 Download the **Nymph’s Savage World list file** (`.wabbajack`) from Nexus:  
  👉 [Nexus Mods — NSW Wabbajack File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154913)

## ▶️ Step 4 — Run Wabbajack

1. Launch **Wabbajack.exe**  
2. Click **Install From Disk** and select `NymphsSavageWorld.wabbajack`  
3. **Installation Location:** choose something like `D:\NSW` (avoid `Program Files`)  
4. **Downloads Location:** e.g., `D:\NSW\Downloads`  
5. Log into **Nexus Mods** when prompted  
   - Premium is **recommended** for faster automated downloads.  
6. Click **Start** and wait — this can take a while!  

---

## ▶️ Step 5 — Launch the Game

- After Wabbajack finishes:  
  1. Use **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)** from the NSW folder.  
  2. Select **SKSE** in the MO2 drop-down.  
  3. Click **Run**.
  4. The game will load and it may be very stretched.
  5. Simply exit the game, press Alt+F4 if you can't use the menu.
  6. Reload the game and it will look normal.
  7. This is a windows related issue that just needs to see the game run once to configure.
- 🎉 You’re now in Nymph’s Savage World!
