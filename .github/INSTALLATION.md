This guide will help you install the list step by step.

## ▶️ Step 1 — Prepare Skyrim

1. Make sure you have **Skyrim Special Edition** (Steam).  
2. In Steam, right-click Skyrim → **Properties** → **Updates**  
   - Set to: **Only update this game when I launch it**  
3. Install **all Anniversary Edition content** (from the Steam “Manage DLC” menu).  
   - ⚠️ Do not alt-tab out while this is downloading — let it finish.  
4. Launch Skyrim once from Steam to generate the base config files.  
   - Set graphics options & quit.

## ▶️ Step 2 — Install Wabbajack

- 📥 Download the **Wabbajack app installer**:  
  👉 [Wabbajack Releases (official)](https://www.wabbajack.org/)  

- Place `Wabbajack.exe` in a dedicated folder (e.g., `D:\Wabbajack`) outside of `Program Files`.

---

## ▶️ Step 3 — Get the NSW Modlist

- 📦 Download the **Nymph’s Savage World list file** (`.wabbajack`) from Nexus:  
  👉 [Nexus Mods — NSW Wabbajack File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154913)  

---

## ▶️ Step 4 — Run Wabbajack

1. Launch **Wabbajack.exe**  
2. Click **Install From Disk** and select `NymphsSavageWorld.wabbajack`  
3. **Installation Location:** choose something like `D:\NSW` (avoid `Program Files`)  
4. **Downloads Location:** e.g., `D:\NSW\Downloads`  
5. Log into **Nexus Mods** when prompted  
   - Premium is **recommended** for faster automated downloads.  
6. Click **Start** and wait — this can take a while!  
7. It's common for the first install to fail sometimes, often you need to "retry" a few times to get all the needed files, dont worry.

## 🔧 Post-Installation Notes

- If you want to play with a controller, enable the **"Nymphs - Controller"** mod at the bottom of your load order.  
- This list is still in **Beta Phase**:  
  - It has **not yet been optimized** for all system configurations  
  - Lower-end systems may struggle with performance  
  - **No LODs are currently included** and landscapes are heavy — optimization for accessibility will come later  
- On **first launch**, your display size may be incorrect (Windows DPI quirk) — it should fix itself on the second launch.  
- Some **combat settings** must be configured manually in the MCM (check Discord or documentation for setup screenshots).  

---

## ▶️ Step 5 — Launch the Game

- After Wabbajack finishes:  
  1. Use **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)** from the NSW folder.  
  2. Select **Nymphs savage World** in the MO2 drop-down, if not already selected.  
  3. Click **Run**.  
- 🎉 You’re now in Nymph’s Savage World!
