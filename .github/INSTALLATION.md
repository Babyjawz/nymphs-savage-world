# ðŸ“¥ Installation Guide â€” Nymphâ€™s Savage World

This guide will walk you through installing **Nymphâ€™s Savage World** using [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Skyrim Special Edition / Anniversary Edition** (Steam version, fully updated)  
- A clean install (no leftover mods or loose files)  
- At least **240GB free disk space** (install + downloads)  
- **Windows 10/11**  

---

## Steps

1. **Prepare Skyrim**
   - Uninstall Skyrim SE/AE from Steam if already modded.  
   - Delete any leftover files in your `Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition` folder.  
   - Reinstall Skyrim SE/AE fresh.  
   - Launch the game once from Steam to generate INI files, then exit.  

2. **Install Wabbajack**
   - Download the latest [Wabbajack.exe](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/latest/download/Wabbajack.exe).  
   - Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack\` (not inside Program Files).  

3. **Download the Modlist**
   - Open Wabbajack and select **Browse Modlists**.  
   - Search for **Nymphâ€™s Savage World**.  
   - Click the install button.  

4. **Choose Install Locations**
   - Set the **Installation Location** (e.g. `C:\WJ-Lists\NymphsSavageWorld\`).  
   - Set the **Download Location** (Wabbajack will cache mod downloads here for reuse).  

5. **Run the Installer**
   - Click the **Play/Go** button.  
   - Wait â€” this can take a long time depending on your internet and hardware.  
   - If Wabbajack fails, try again before asking for support (sometimes servers drop requests).  

6. **Launch the Game**
   - After installation, open **ModOrganizer.exe** inside your installation folder.  
   - Run the game using the **SKSE** entry in MO2â€™s drop-down menu.

## Post-Installation

### LODs (Level of Detail)
- LODs are included and **already pre-generated**.  
- No extra steps are required â€” just install and play.  

### Graphics & Shaders
- The list uses **Community Shaders** as its graphics base.  
- **Do not install ENBs** â€” they will conflict and break visuals.  
- Optional shader packs and presets are included and configured by default.  

### First Launch
- The first run may stutter while shaders and caches are generated.  
- This will smooth out after a few minutes of play.

## Troubleshooting

- **Installer fails** â†’ Run it again. Temporary download/server issues are common.  
- **Game crashes on launch** â†’ Make sure you start from **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)**, not Steam.  try again, skyrim cant be janky
- **Weird lighting/shadows** â†’ report any seams etc on our discord
- **Persistent problems** â†’  ask in Discord.

## Notes

- This is a **Beta** release. Expect frequent updates.  
- If you update, re-run the Wabbajack installer â€” it will only download and update changed files.
