Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Nymphs Savage World**!  
This modlist is a collaborative effort, but to keep it organized and maintainable, we follow some simple rules.

---

## 🚫 What You Cannot Contribute

- ❌ Full mods, asset packs, or anything over **10 MB**  
- ❌ Textures, meshes, sounds, animations, or DLLs  
- ❌ Mods or patches you **do not have permission** to redistribute  

For those, please **come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ezJVqBJvVj)** and discuss first.

---

## ✅ What You Can Contribute

- Small **configuration files** (`.ini`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.yaml`)  
- Small **patches or plugins** (`.esp`, `.esl`, `.esm`) under 10 MB  
- Documentation **inside your PR description** (don’t edit `README.md` directly)  
- Small utility files (example: xEdit scripts, settings tweaks)  

---

## 📥 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. Create a **new branch** for your changes  
3. Add your files (allowed file types only)  
4. Open a **Pull Request (PR)**  
5. **Fill out the Pull Request Template** — required for all contributions  
   - This will appear automatically when you open a PR  
   - Includes a checklist for allowed file types, labels, and description

## 🏷 Labels & Categories

When opening a PR, assign at least one label:  

- ✨ **enhancement** → new features, content, or major mods added  
- 🛠 **tweak** → small adjustments and refinements  
- ⚖️ **balance** → gameplay/mechanical balancing  
- 🐛 **bug** → fixes for crashes, broken mods, or errors  
- 📝 **docs** → documentation changes  
- 🔧 **other** → uncategorized changes  

Unlabeled changes will be caught by the **📦 uncategorized** catch-all.

---

## 📂 File Placement Rules

- ❌ Do **not** add files in the repository root.
- ✅ Put notes, patches, and configs under: `docs/notes/<yourname>/`
- ✅ Root is reserved for core files only: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `modlist.json`, `banner.(png|jpg|jpeg|webp)`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

Pull requests that add new files to the root will be rejected by CI. If you think an exception is needed, ask in Discord first.


## ⚠️ Final Notes

- Keep PRs **focused and small** — don’t bundle multiple unrelated changes  
- If in doubt, **open an issue first** or ask in Discord before making big changes  
- PRs that don’t follow these rules may be closed
