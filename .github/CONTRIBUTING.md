# 🤝 Contributing to Nymphs Savage World

First off — thank you for your interest in **Nymphs Savage World**!  
This project is driven by our community, the **Nymph Nerds**, and we welcome new Nymphs into the fold.

## 🌐 The Main Way to Contribute

Join us on **Discord**:  
👉 [Nymphs Savage World Discord](https://discord.gg/ezJVqBJvVj)

We’ll help shape them into something ready for the modlist.

## 📥 Submissions via GitHub

For those comfortable with GitHub, you can still open a **Pull Request (PR)**.  
The main purpose of PRs is to **log changes you’d like to see**:  

- Mods to **add / remove / update**  
- Load order notes or **integration requirements**  
- Nexus links and reasons why the change is needed  
- Optional small config/patch files:  
  - `.ini`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.yml`  
  - Tiny xEdit patches: `.esp`, `.esl`, `.esm` (≤ 10 MB)  

💡 **Do not upload** full mods, large assets (meshes, textures, sounds, DLLs), or anything without redistribution permission. Instead, just **link the Nexus page**.
