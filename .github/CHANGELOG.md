
## 1.6.0.3 small update to fix dodging (replaces tk dodge with dmco)
## 1.0.6.4 changed TDM settings for proper directional dodge and power attacks

## [v1.0.6.2] - 2025-12-17

### ⚠️ Save Compatibility Notice
- This update removes a significant amount of legacy content and bloat
- Existing saves may report missing content and cannot be guaranteed to remain stable
- Continuing an existing save may still work, but starting a new save is strongly recommended
- This change breaks from previous save-safe policy but was necessary to resolve foundational issues
- Future updates are expected to be significantly more save-safe
