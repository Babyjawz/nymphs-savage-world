## ⚠️ Notes for Players

- This list is still in **Alpha**: expect bugs, missing LODs, and performance quirks.  
- Controller users: enable **“Nymphs - Controller”** mod at the bottom of your load order.  
- First launch may show the wrong resolution (Windows DPI scaling) — fixed on restart.  
- Combat settings require MCM tweaks (see Discord for recommended configs).
