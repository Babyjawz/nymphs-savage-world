## 🔧 Post-Installation Notes

- If you want to play with a controller, enable the **"Nymphs - Controller"** mod at the bottom of your load order.  
- This list is still in **Alpha Phase**:  
  - It has **not yet been optimized** for all system configurations  
  - Lower-end systems may struggle with performance  
  - **No LODs are currently included** and landscapes are heavy — optimization for accessibility will come later  
- On **first launch**, your display size may be incorrect (Windows DPI quirk) — it should fix itself on the second launch.  
- Some **combat settings** must be configured manually in the MCM (check Discord or documentation for setup screenshots).
