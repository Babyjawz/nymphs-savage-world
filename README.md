## 🔧 Post-Installation Notes

- **Controller Users**: At the bottom of the load order you’ll find a mod called **“Nymphs - Controller”**. Enable this if you want to play with a controller.  
- **Performance & Optimization**: Being in Alpha, the list has **not yet been optimized** for different system configs. Landscapes are heavy, and **LODs are currently missing**. Work will be done later to improve accessibility.  
- **First Launch Quirk**: On the first launch, the game window may appear at the wrong size (Windows DPI scaling issue). It should correct itself on the **second launch**.  
- **MCM Settings**: Some combat-related MCM options still need configuring. Keep an eye on the documentation/Discord for the recommended setup.

## 🐛 Known Issues

As this list is still in **Alpha**, you may encounter problems.  
We track issues in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md), but here are the current major ones:

- Performance is **not yet optimized** for lower-end systems  
- **LODs are missing**, making landscapes heavier than normal  
- Some **MCM combat settings** still require manual tweaking  
- On **first launch**, the game window may appear at the wrong size (DPI scaling issue). This usually fixes itself on the second launch  

👉 Please check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for updates as we work on fixes.  
👉 If you discover new problems, please report them in our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/ezJVqBJvVj) rather than GitHub Issues (issues will open at Beta).
