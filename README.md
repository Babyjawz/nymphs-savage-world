## 🛠️ Post-Installation Tips & Troubleshooting

### First Launch
- Always launch Skyrim through **SKSE** inside **Mod Organizer 2 (MO2)**  
- On your **first load**, expect a slightly longer startup as scripts initialize  
- The **game window may appear at the wrong size** on the first launch — this is caused by how Windows handles DPI scaling and should be corrected on the next launch  

### MCM Configuration
After your first successful launch, open the **Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)** in-game. Some features will not function correctly until configured.  
Recommended areas to check:  
- **Combat** (MCO movesets, stamina/magicka options, difficulty tweaks)  
- **Custom UI** (Equipment Fast-Change HUD options, scaling, controller/keyboard toggle)  
- **Follower Management** (via Nethers Follower Framework)  
- **Magic & Religion** (Odin, Gods and Worship systems)  
- **NSFW systems** (OStim consent settings, toggles)  

### Controller Support
- At the **bottom of the load order**, there is a mod called **“Nymphs - Controller”**  
- Enable this mod if you want to play with a controller  
- Leave it disabled if you are only using keyboard and mouse  

### Stability & Performance Notes
- This modlist is currently in **Alpha phase**  
  - It has **not yet been optimized** for different system configurations  
  - Performance on lower-end systems may be poor at this stage  
- Currently, there are **no LODs (Level of Detail)** — landscapes are visually heavy and may impact performance  
- Work will be done in future updates to optimize the list for better accessibility and smoother gameplay  

### General Stability Tips
- Save often — preferably in **multiple slots**  
- Avoid using **quick saves** (use manual saves or the MCM save manager if included)  
- If you crash:
  - Check logs in `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\`
  - Ask for help in the **#support channel** on Discord with your logs and error messages  

### Common Issues
- **Game fails to start** → Make sure you are launching via **SKSE in MO2**, not directly from Steam  
- **Missing textures/meshes** → Verify your downloads folder wasn’t cleaned or moved  
- **Out of disk space** → The modlist requires **at least 500 GB** (recommend a large SSD)
