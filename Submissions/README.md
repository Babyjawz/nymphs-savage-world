# Submissions

![Submission Process](../.github/assets/fairyflowchart3.png)

This folder is the drop-zone for contribution requests via Pull Request.  
You don’t need to upload mods — just describe what you’d like to see changed.

---

## ✅ What you can submit

- A single **.md** or **.txt** file with:
  - **Mods to add / remove / update**
  - **Load order notes** (relative positions are fine)
  - **Nexus links** (and any requirements)
  - **Brief reasoning** (performance, visuals, bugfix, balance, etc.)

- Optional small config/patch files (each file ≤ **10 MB**):
  - `.ini`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.yml`
  - Tiny xEdit patches: `.esp`, `.esl`, `.esm`

> 💡 Most PRs will be **request-only**: one text/markdown file with links and notes is perfect.

---

## ❌ Do not upload

- Full mods or large assets (meshes, textures, sounds, animations, DLLs)  
- Anything you **don’t have permission** to redistribute

👉 Instead, **link the Nexus page** and we’ll fetch it during curation.
